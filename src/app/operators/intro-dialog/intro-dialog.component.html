        <p>Welcome to RxJs Operators visualizer, here you can visualize RxJs operators in action with a beautiful design about pizza. I really hope you enjoy it because pixel art is not easy :)</p>

            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            <p>
                I've created this web app to make the study of RxJs, used for NgRx (Angular) and react-redux (React/React-Native), more easy. Even for me, developing this visualizer should increase my 
                reactive development skills. I would be very happy if the web community join me in this adventure. 
                Feel free to help the visualizer grow, here you can access the <a href="">repository on github</a>.

                On the left corner of the website you should be able to see a big stream of pizza, the top square represents the last pizza generated by the kitchen. sometimes 
                another stream will show to you for some merge operators.
